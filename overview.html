<!-- About Section -->
<div class="section about-section">
  <p>
    Located in Bucks County, PA, we’ve been quietly protecting our local community in Bucks, 
    Montgomery and Philadelphia for years. As a locally owned insurance brokerage, our focus 
    is on people first, specifically helping families and businesses find the right coverage 
    and peace of mind.  
  </p>

  <p>
    We specialize in personal insurance and also support our customer's commercial and life insurance
    needs, offering tailored solutions that fit your unique needs. Whether it’s your home, auto, business, 
    or life, we take the time to understand your risks and provide guidance you can trust.  And of 
    course don't forget about the toys!  We provide coverage for boats, RVs, jewelry and most other
    assets you want to protect.
  </p>

  <p>
    While our brokerage continues to grow, our commitment to exceptional customer service 
    remains unchanged. We pride ourselves on being accessible, responsive, and attentive to 
    our existing customers.  TLC offers the direct and personal service large insurers often
    struggle to including annual reviews, direct access for policy updates and easy access for 
    questions, updates or new quotes.  
  </p>

  <p>
    We’re here to help you protect what matters most, today and in the future.

  <p>We believe insurance is not one size fits all. To ensure we fully understand your needs 
    and match you with the right coverage from our network of insurers, quotes are not available 
    through our website.</p>
