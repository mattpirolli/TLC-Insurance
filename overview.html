<!-- About Section -->
<div class="section about-section">
  <p>
    Located in Bucks County, PA, we’ve been quietly protecting our local community for years. 
    As a locally owned insurance brokerage, our focus has always been on people first, 
    specifically helping families and businesses find the right coverage and peace of mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    We specialize in personal, commercial, and life insurance, offering tailored solutions 
    that fit your unique needs. Whether it’s your home, auto, business, or life, we take 
    the time to understand your risks and provide guidance you can trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    While our brokerage continues to grow, our commitment to exceptional customer service 
    remains unchanged. We pride ourselves on being accessible, responsive, and attentive—delivering 
    the kind of service larger insurers often can’t.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’re here to help you protect what matters most, today and in the future.
